# XOR-Problem-using-Neural-Network
The XOR problem is very famous in the machine learning domain. An XOR truth table cannot be classified correctly by a single perceptron. This shows that XOR is not solvable by linear classifiers. However, XOR can be solved using a group of perceptrons also called as a neural network. This code will show you how this is done.
